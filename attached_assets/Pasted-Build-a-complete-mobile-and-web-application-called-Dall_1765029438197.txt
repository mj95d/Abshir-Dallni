Build a complete mobile and web application called “Dalleni”.
The concept: an AI-powered personal assistant that helps users perform official inquiries, renew services, check leaked personal data, and get guided steps for any government or daily service.

Core Features

• Auto-generate forms and checklists.

Dark Web Monitoring (HIBP Integration)

• Show cost, payment steps, required documents.

Government Services Hub
