PROMPT

Build a complete feature called “Dallni Support Center”.
This feature must operate inside the Dallni platform and must NOT integrate directly with Absher or send tickets to Absher.
It only helps users organize their issues, get AI guidance, and optionally open Absher’s official support page.

⭐ Feature Requirements
1) Create Support Ticket (New Ticket Form)

Build a form where the user can submit a support request.
The form must include:

serviceType (dropdown: إقامة، نقل ملكية، تجديد استمارة، بلاغات، مواعيد، بلدي، مرور…)

issueDescription (text)

userEmail

userPhone

nationalID (optional)

attachments (images/PDF)

submit button

After submission:

Ticket stored in database

User sees confirmation + ticket number

2) AI Assistant (Pre-Support Smart Helper)

Before the ticket reaches the human dashboard, the AI must:

Read the user’s issue

Analyze it

Suggest official solutions

Provide official Absher links only

Tell the user if:

the service requires a branch

the service can be completed online

the service requires specific documents

the issue is not related to Absher

AI output format:

Short explanation

Step-by-step instructions

Required documents

Official links

Recommendation:

either “Your issue can be solved directly here → [Absher link]”

OR “Your ticket has been sent to Dallni Support Center for further help.”

3) Ticket Status Workflow

Every ticket must have one of the following statuses:

NEW

IN REVIEW

RESOLVED

REQUIRES OFFICIAL CONTACT
(This means: “We recommend using Absher official support link.”)

Create backend endpoints to update these statuses:

/api/tickets/create

/api/tickets/updateStatus

/api/tickets/getUserTickets

4) Ticket Details Page

For each ticket, show:

Ticket number

Status (with color tags)

User info

Service type

Description

AI recommended solution

Attachments

Timeline of updates

5) Admin Dashboard (For Dallni Team Only)

Build a simple dashboard:

List all tickets

Filter by status

View details

Add comments/notes

Change status

Mark ticket as “Resolved”

Mark ticket as “Requires Official Absher Support”

6) Absher Official Support Button

Every ticket page must include a button:

🔗 Open Official Absher Support

This must open:

https://www.absher.sa/


The system must NOT:

send data to Absher

auto-fill the user’s data

perform login

contact internal APIs

Just open the official website.

⭐ 7) Security & Compliance Requirements

DO NOT store passwords or OTPs

DO NOT attempt Absher login

DO NOT access restricted government APIs

All user data must be stored securely

Allow users to delete their tickets

National ID is optional

Attachments must be virus-scanned or validated

All links must be official

⭐ 8) UX Requirements

UI/UX must be:

Arabic (RTL)

Modern

Simple for elderly users

With large buttons

Clear ticket timeline

AI response shown in a clean card

Use labels such as:

فتح تذكرة جديدة

ننصحك بالتواصل مع الدعم الرسمي لأبشر

⭐ Final Output

The system must generate:

Full frontend pages

Backend API routes

Database models

AI assistant integration

Admin dashboard

Ticket UI and timeline

Absher contact button

Security constraints

All in one integrated module called:

Dallni Support Center
