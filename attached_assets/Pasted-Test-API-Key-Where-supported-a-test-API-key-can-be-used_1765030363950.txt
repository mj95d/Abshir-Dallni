Test API Key
Where supported, a test API key can be used instead of a paid subscription. Test keys provide limited access (typically to test accounts) and may be any value that conforms to the required key format. For example:

GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/{service}/{parameter}
hibp-api-key: 00000000000000000000000000000000
Specifying the API version
Version 3 of the API is consumable only by specifying the API version in the URL. All API endpoints are requested with the following pattern:

GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/{service}/{parameter}
Specifying the user agent
Each request to the API must be accompanied by a user agent request header. Typically this should be the name of the app consuming the service. A missing user agent will result in an HTTP 403 response. A valid request would look like:

GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/{service}/{parameter}
user-agent: [your app name]
The user agent should accurately describe the nature of the API consumer such that it can be clearly identified in the request. Not doing so may result in the request being blocked.

Breaches
Getting all breaches for an account
The most common use of the API is to return a list of all breaches a particular account has been involved in. The API takes a single parameter which is the account to be searched for. The account is not case-sensitive and will be trimmed of leading or trailing white spaces. The account should always be URL encoded. This is an authenticated API and an HIBP API key must be passed with the request.

GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breachedaccount/{account}
hibp-api-key: [your key]
If the account is found in a breach, an HTTP 200 response is returned. By default, only the name of the breach is returned rather than the complete breach data, thus reducing the response body size by approximately 98% compared to returning the full breach model.

[
  {
    "Name": "Adobe"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Gawker"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Stratfor"
  }
]
The name can then be used to either retrieve a single breach or it can be found in the list of all breaches in the system. If you'd like complete breach data returned in the API call, a non-truncated response can be specified via query string parameter:

Parameter	Example	Description
truncateResponse	?truncateResponse=false	Returns the full breach model.
Which returns the complete model for each breach:

    "Title": "Adobe",
    "Domain": "adobe.com",
    "BreachDate": "2013-10-04",
